Progress Since Last Report
---
* Learned a bunch of Maven stuff to get my build environment going
* Had to end up using `mvn install:install-file` command to get Maven to use my local repo
* Moved from the default template language to Pebble
* Edited an existing template tag and now and working on building my own

Problems Encountered
---
* Maven was horrible to learn, and there were issues with not referencing the right version of Pebble so the webserver would stall when trying to load the Initializer for the template language.

Next Steps
---
* Work on actually deveoping the new template functionality.
