Progress Since Last Report
---
* Decided to work on issue https://github.com/decebals/pippo/issues/260
* Got the existing project on my local machine and compiled
* I am working on getting a sandbox web application running using the compiled version of Pippo.

Problems Encountered
---
* The main issue is that I can use a pre-compiled version of Pippo in Ubuntu, but I cannot figure out how to be able to write a web app and import Pippo objects using the source code. I think it has to do with Classpaths.

Next Steps
---
* Study your makefiles to see how you handle classpaths.
* Get the app running and use a template tag so I know how the template tag system is coded.
