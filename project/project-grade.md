Class Presentation
===

Evaluation
---
+  Easy to follow
+  Well prepared, clear you understood the project
+  Good description of the project, the problem you had to solve, and how you
   went about it
+  Stayed w/in the time limit
+  Included demo of your code working
+  Good walk through of the code base, easy to follow
+  I also really like that you stepped us through the difficulties you had
   in solving the problem.  Hearing about the problems is just as important
   as the solutions
+  I also really appreciated the background description of what a web app is,
   so that others in the class who aren't familiar with the area could
   still follow along
